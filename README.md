# Welcome to the Policy and Growth Git Repository

I doubt that this will be useful for the entire cohort, 
but it can at least serve as a way for me to get files and code to you guys 
(even if it means just downloading it from a browser!)

Note that all code will be placed in the "Master" branch,
besides this file, main will be kept mostly empty.

頑張ってね皆さん～
